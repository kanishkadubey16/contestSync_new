## 🎯 Project Idea

Competitive programmers often struggle to track contests happening across multiple platforms.  
ContestSync solves this by:

- Showing all upcoming contests in a single dashboard
- Sending reminder notifications before a contest starts
- Allowing users to choose contests they want to participate in
- Making contest management easy and stress-free
